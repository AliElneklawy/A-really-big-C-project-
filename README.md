# Password-Protected Book Management System
**Note**: This is my first project ever. So, the code won't look so good to you. But it works anyway!

The program has a very simple interface (shown below). You can notice the date and time at the top left coner.

It is also passowrd-protected (you can disable it. Your choice!).

The searching feature enables you to search by *_partially_* writing the name of the author or the book. So, you don't need to memorize the full title or the name of the author!
